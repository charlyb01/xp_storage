# XP Storage

A mod that lets you store your experience into an item!

Based on [XP Tome](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xp-tome) (itself based on 
[XP Book](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xp-book)). Not a port from Forge! This mod is fully rewritten 
and adds new features.

Now three XP Books are available with different amounts of experience that you can store into it! Respectively 30, 42 
and 69 levels for XP Book I, II, and III

**IMPORTANT!** Invert the damage system in last update, check out the changelog for more information!

## Controls

* Right click: store the maximum amount of your experience in the book. If you have more experience than the maximum 
  amount, you will keep the remaining experience
* Right click while sneaking: get the experience stored in the book
* XP Book recipe: 1 book (of course, it's a book), 3 lapis lazuli (it stores experience so lapis needed makes senses), 
  and 1 diamond (it's quite powerful and precious so still makes senses)
* **NEW:** you can now upgrade the book so that it can store more experience! Same recipe but replace the book with 
  your XP Book and the diamond with either a netherite ingot or a nether star (depending on the XP Book level)

## FAQ

* **Does it work on a server?** Yes it works on a server. File needed for both client and server. And yes, it means you 
  can share experience with other players.
* **Can I include it in my modpack?** Yes, you are free to include this mod into your modpack. Just let me know if you 
  do so! ðŸ˜‰
* **For any other things:** Feel free to share your experience, problems (prefer the Issue link instead of Comment, but 
  it's okay too), enhancement ideas... down in the comment section

## Known compatibility issues

* **Tweakeroo:** using the *TWEAK_SWAP_ALMOST_BROKEN_TOOLS* doesn't let you use the XP Book when it's (almost) full as 
  it's considered almost broken

I'm working on those with the mod's owners when needed. I'll let you know when it's fixed!
