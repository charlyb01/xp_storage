# XP Storage

A mod that lets you store your experience in multiple ways!

Based on [XP Tome](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xp-tome) (itself based on 
[XP Book](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xp-book)). Not a port from Forge! This mod is fully rewritten 
and adds new features.

## Description

In this mod, you can craft XP Books in order to store your experience and save it from a coming death. After storing 
it, you can retrieve your experience back in two different ways: same way that you stored it OR you can brew the 
experience of the XP Book with the brewing stand in order to create special Experience Bottles that can give you even 
more experience.

* **XP Book recipe:** 1 book (of course, it's a book), 3 lapis lazuli (it stores experience so lapis needed makes senses),
  and 1 diamond (it's quite powerful and precious so still makes senses)
* **XP Book upgrade recipe:** you can upgrade the book so that it can store more experience. Same recipe but replace the 
  book with your XP Book and the diamond with either a netherite ingot or a nether star (depending on your current XP 
  Book level)
* **Store experience:** Store the maximum amount of your experience in the book by ***right clicking***. If you have 
  more experience than the maximum amount, you will keep the remaining experience
* **Retrieve experience:** 
  * Get the exact amount of experience stored in the book by ***right clicking while sneaking***
  * Take 100 of experience stored in the book and put a random percentage of it between 85% and 130% for each 
    ***mundane potions*** placed in the brewing stand

## FAQ

* **Does it work on a server?** Yes it works on a server. File needed for both client and server. And yes, it means you 
  can share experience with other players.
* **Can I include it in my modpack?** Yes, you are free to include this mod into your modpack. Just let me know if you 
  do so! ðŸ˜‰
* **For any other things:** Feel free to share your experience, problems (prefer the Issue link instead of Comment, but 
  it's okay too), enhancement ideas... down in the comment section

## Known compatibility issues

* **Tweakeroo:** using the *TWEAK_SWAP_ALMOST_BROKEN_TOOLS* doesn't let you use the XP Book when it's (almost) full as 
  it's considered almost broken

I'm working on those with the mod's owners when needed. I'll let you know when it's fixed!
